* Possibly remove the /book-converter command (or at least deprecate it)
* Finish an api and add events to let plugins hook into
* Add caching through the use of external files (to save RAM and persist after a reboot)
* Add version checking (on documentation books) and auto-update them
* Possibly use another host besides this repo
